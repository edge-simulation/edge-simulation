{% include figure.html image="/assets/void.jpg" caption='The location of the EDGE dark matter haloes selected for higher resolution resimulation from a lower resolution void at z=0. Each panel shows a surface density plot of a cube. The zoomed panels for each halo are taken from the ‘DMO’ simulations out to r200c, and show the corresponding M200c mass, as marked. For Halo600, there is a partial-zoom to help illustrate how small the selected haloes are in comparison to the total box size (50 Mpc). From Orkney+ 2021.' width="898" %}
