{% include video.html video="/assets/movies/orkney2022/gc_cusp_movie.mp4" caption="The evolution of a star cluster in a pristine LCDM cusp background potential. The steep gravitational tides rapidly strip stars from the cluster, inhibiting its size growth and destroying it after 1.5Gyr." %}

{% include video.html video="/assets/movies/orkney2022/gc_core_movie.mp4" caption="The evolution of a star cluster in a fully cored background potential, where the star cluster is initially rotating with a velocity of 1.75km/s at the half-mass radius (5pc) and has a high ellipticity (e=0.30). The star cluster survives in the host potential for a Hubble time, and retains much of its initial ellipticity. This is because the weak gravitational tides in the core allow the star cluster to preserve its high angular momentum material." %}

{% include video.html video="/assets/movies/orkney2022/gc_splat_movie.mp4" caption="The evolution of a star cluster in a partially cored background potential. The gravitational tides encourage the formation of tidal tails, and the lowered background potential allows for a large cluster size as compared to a pristine LCDM cusp. After 1.25Gyr, the star cluster remains relatively large despite a high degree of tidal deformation." %}
