The following are videos of Nbody6 simulations of an Eridanus II-like cluster in a dwarf galaxy potential presented in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220113434O/">EDGE: The puzzling ellipticity of Eridanus II's star cluster and its implications for dark matter at the heart of an ultra-faint dwarf</a>.

Videos were created by Matthew Orkney.

The star cluster survives in the host potential for a Hubble time, and retains much of its initial ellipticity. This is because the weak gravitational tides in the core allow the star cluster to preserve its high angular momentum material." %}

{% include video.html video="/assets/movies/orkney2022/gc_splat_movie.mp4" caption="The evolution of a star cluster in a partially cored background potential. The gravitational tides encourage the formation of tidal tails, and the lowered background potential allows for a large cluster size as compared to a pristine LCDM cusp. After 1.25Gyr, the star cluster remains relatively large despite a high degree of tidal deformation." %}
