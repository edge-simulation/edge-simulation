EDGE is a project to numerically simulate the very smallest galaxies in the Universe. It is a collaboration between the University of Surrey (PI Read), University College London and the University of Lund. The simulations are set up using the new <a href="https://github.com/pynbody/genetIC">GenetIC</a> initial conditions generator and run using the <a href="https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html">RAMSES</a> code. Analysis of simulation outputs is performed using the <a href="http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/Download.html">AHF</a> halo finder and the <a href="https://pynbody.github.io/">PyNbody and Tangoes</a> analysis tools.
